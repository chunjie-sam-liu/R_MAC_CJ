The hypergeometric distribution is used for sampling without replacement. The density of this distribution with parameters m, n and k (named Np, N-Np, and n, respectively in the reference below) is given by

p(x) = choose(m, x) choose(n, k-x) / choose(m+n, k)

for x = 0, â€¦, k.

```{r}
m <- 10; n <- 7; k <- 8
x <- 0:(k+1)
rbind(phyper(x, m, n, k), dhyper(x, m, n, k))
all(phyper(x, m, n, k) == cumsum(dhyper(x, m, n, k))) 
```
